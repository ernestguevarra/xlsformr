Description: Open Data Kit (ODK) uses a low-level form specification based on
    XForms. However, XForms can still prove challenging to use for creating
    forms. XLSForm, a high-level spreadsheet-based form specification, has been
    developed to facilitate creation of ODK forms for majority of users as it
    uses a tool that is familiar with most. This package provides functions to
    create an XLSForm using R.
