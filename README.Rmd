# xlsformr: Creating XLSForms for Open Data Kit Using R

Open Data Kit (ODK) uses a low-level form specification based on XForms. However, XForms can still prove challenging to use for creating forms. XLSForm, a high-level spreadsheet-based form specification, has been developed to facilitate creation of ODK forms for majority of users as it uses a tool that is familiar with most. This package provides functions to create an XLSForm using R.
